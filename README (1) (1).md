# 💡Inspiration
This holiday season we wanted to create something interesting for people so that they can take time off their chores and have some fun. we wanted to build a Christmas theme-based game that can be played by people of any age group.

# 🎯 What it does
The project is a Christmas-based obstacle race wherein the character(Santa) must cross Christmas trees without hitting them. The game prompts a game over when the character hits the obstacle.

# 🛠 How we built it 
-  We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for building this game.

# 💪 Challenges we ran into
- We were having trouble providing conditions for the character and setting position values, but eventually, we could try to add basic functionality to the game.

# 📌 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We could create a basic interactive game which can be played by people of any age group.
- This was our first hackathon and we could build something in it.
- We could get hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- We could work together as a team in the imposed time constraints.

# 📚 What we learned
- we learned how to build a website using HTML and CSS and the basics of Javascript.
- We learned how to work in a team while having time constraints imposed.
- We learned how to leverage information out of various learning platforms.

# ⏭ What's next for SantaOnTheRun?
- We are planning to provide a scoreboard which shows rankings of all our users globally.
- We are planning to allow our users to be able to create accounts so that they can keep track of their scores.
- We are planning to add user verification to prevent bots from playing the game.
- We are also planning to add additional features to the game like Santa would drop a gift when encounters a kid etc...
